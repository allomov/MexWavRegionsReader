About
-----
This is a simple parser of RIFF wave files that extracts information about markers to Matlab.


Motivation
----------
Voice analysis and synthesis often needs to add markers to audio records. 
The common approach is to add them in riff wave format. This project solve a problem 
extracting information about markers from RIFF files to implement speech synthesis algorithms in Matlab.


How to use
----------
This project is build under WindowsXP, if you want to use other operating system, 
you'll need to [build .mex file](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/before-you-run-a-mex-file.html)
Then you can add folder with .mex file to your [Matlab Path](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/mex-file-placement.html) 
and use it as a matlab function.
